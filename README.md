## Finished thus far
### Literature survey
We looked into the aspects of cloud applications and how they function. We looked into the Apache Umbrella and a few of its projects with a focus on big data. We looked into the Software Ecosystem of the cloud as well as the analysis of Java Applications. 

## Future Goals
**Aanchal** - Understand the usecase of strace and perf in Netflix as a microservice. Identify tools used for analysis of these microservices. Develop a simple string manipulation microservice in Java. 
**Arushi** - Understand the method of communication in Hadoop Map Reduce. Develop a simple addition microservice in C
**Janya** - Understand the technology currently employed in microservice communications. Develop a simple string manipulation micro service in C.
**Sowmya** - Understand the building of micro services. Develop a simple addition microservice in Java
